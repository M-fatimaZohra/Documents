## Deployment Process

### Steps for Deployment

1. **Build the project**:

   npm run start
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Push code to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "your message"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:

   - Log in to your [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account.
   - Import the GitHub repository for the project.
   - Start the deployment process.

4. **Fix Environment Variables**:

   - Navigate to the project dashboard in Vercel.
   - Go to `Settings > Environment Variables`.
   - Upload the `.env.local` file.

5. **Redeploy the project**:

   - Go to the project dashboard > Deployment section.
   - On the latest deployment, click the `...` menu.
   - Select "Redeploy" and confirm.

6. **Successful Deployment**: Once redeployed, the project should work as expected.

## Issues and Workarounds

- **Experimental API Warning**:
  The build log includes the following warning:

  ```
  This is an experimental API version, which will change without warning and may have serious bugs.
  ```

  - **Solution**: Ensure the API version is compatible with the current dependencies and frameworks being used. Check the API documentation for updates or stable versions.

- **Route and Dynamic Features Glitch**:

  - `/Shop/:id` route not functioning as expected on Vercel.
  - Dynamic features like rating color changes, counters, and alert buttons are not responsive.
  - **Solution**: Debug these features locally and ensure compatibility with the production environment. Use logging or debugging tools to identify the root cause.
